# Dear Mr. Xu,

It’s hard to believe the time has come to say goodbye. Knowing that you won’t be returning next year makes this goodbye even more meaningful for me, but I didn’t want to miss the chance to let you know just how much of an impact you’ve had for me, Griffin, Isaac, Cooper, Kadence, Lia, McKinley, Max, Jake, Cristian, Riley, Jagger, Wyatt, Alex, Kyler, Allie, Sam, Ciran, Kadence, Noor, Milo, Yona, Ell, Agniv, Paige, Paxton, Ryan, Hannah M, Luna, Lucia, and everyone in you other classes. (I don't know who they are.)

From filming Probably Gonna Give You Up to unraveling tricky math problems and launching into the world of physical science, you brought energy, creativity, and a lot of patience to everything you taught. You didn’t just teach lessons—you made them come alive. Whether we were behind a camera, solving math equations, or learning how speakers work, you made us think, laugh, and learn in ways we’ll never forget.

Your classes were more than just part of our schedule, they were places where we felt inspired, supported, and challenged to grow. You showed us how to express ideas through video, find confidence in math, and explore the science of the world around us with curiosity and excitement.

Even though you won’t be with us next year, your influence will stay. You’ve left behind more than just knowledge—you’ve left memories, inspiration, and a legacy that will stick with your students for years to come.

Thank you for everything. We wish you nothing but success and happiness in whatever comes next. You’ll truly be missed.

# With gratitude and best wishes
